1. create function "initApplicants" to generate and return a structure which contains an array of random numbers, the 	value of the largest number, and the number of variables in the array.
2. Send array of applicants to another function, "chooseApplicant", which will process each array item sequentially 	and return the optimal applicant *without* being able to go back and choose a previous one.
3. Value will be checked to determine whether or not it is correct, after generating n applicant lists and sending them to "chooseApplicant", the results will be tallied and an accuracy rating will be outputted to stdout.
